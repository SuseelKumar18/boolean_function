**Theory**

Boolean functions describe the relationship between binary variables used in digital circuits. Minimization of Boolean functions involves simplifying these functions to their most reduced forms without changing their output behavior.

Minimizing Boolean functions serves to reduce the complexity of digital circuits, which helps in saving hardware resources like logic gates, reducing circuit size, power consumption, and improving speed.

Two popular practical methods for minimization are:

Karnaugh Map (K-Map) Method: A graphical technique where a Boolean function’s truth table is represented in a grid form. Adjacent cells representing ‘1s’ (for SOP form) or ‘0s’ (for POS form) are grouped to create simplified expressions with fewer terms and literals. This method is suitable for functions with up to 4 or 5 variables.

Quine-McCluskey Method: A tabular method used to minimize Boolean functions algorithmically, which is suitable for a larger number of variables. It groups and compares minterms systematically to eliminate redundant variables and obtain minimal expressions.

The minimized Boolean expression obtained from these methods helps to design an optimized logic circuit using fewer gates, which leads to efficient hardware implementation.
